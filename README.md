# Shogi

## Attempt at making the game of Shogi in python

Everything is progress here

## Files

### Piece.py

Declares the piece class and most of the helper functions

### Main.py

Has the pygame version of Shogi

### To Do Notes

- rotate board?
- Add background music
- Add sound effects
- add individual piece images
  - Maybe have a few piece sets to choose from
- Maybe add a main menu
- Maybe store the moves into a log output file
  - SFEN format?
- Really basic AI
  - Maybe just random moves
  - Maybe just a few moves ahead
